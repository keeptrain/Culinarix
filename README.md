# Machine Learning Path

### Recommendation System
The machine learning part of the app has built a recommendation model using collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation. Collaborative filtering is a technique that uses the ratings or preferences of other users to generate recommendations for a target user. Content-based recommendation is a technique that uses the features or attributes of the items to generate recommendations for a target user.

The collaborative filtering model that we built produces a mean squared error of 0.3, which means that the model can predict the ratings of the users with a high accuracy. The system can successfully provide recommendations to the users based on their ratings and preferences.

### Dataset
To create a recommendation model, we decided to build our own dataset. We collected culinary location data from Google Maps and drew inspiration from [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aprabowo/indonesia-tourism-destination) in creating our own.
The dataset we used can be viewed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinnalia6/dataset-culinarix)
